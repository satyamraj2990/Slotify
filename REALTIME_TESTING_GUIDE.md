## 🚀 Step-by-Step Testing Process

### **Step 1: Fix Date Selection Issue**

**Problem:** You mentioned calendar date selection isn't working.

**Solution:** Use the **SimpleLeaveForm** component in the Teacher tab:
1. Login as teacher
2. Go to "Teacher" tab  
3. Scroll down to "🧪 Alternative Leave Form"
4. Use the simple date input field instead of calendar picker

### **Step 2: Test Real-time Notifications**

#### **Option A: Two Different Devices/Browsers**
```bash
# Device 1: Teacher
1. Open Slotify in Browser 1 → Login as Teacher
2. Go to Teacher tab → Submit leave using SimpleLeaveForm

# Device 2: Admin  
3. Open Slotify in Browser 2 → Login as Admin
4. Go to Admin tab → See pending request in Faculty Leave Requests
5. Click "Review" → Click "Approve"

# Device 1: Teacher (automatically)
6. Teacher should INSTANTLY get notification without refresh!
```

#### **Option B: Same Device, Different Tabs**
```bash
# Tab 1: Teacher

# Tab 2: Admin
2. Tab 2: Login as Admin → Approve leave request

# Tab 1: Teacher (check instantly)

```

If any show red ❌, there's a connection issue.

3. Select a substitute teacher from dropdown
4. Submit reallocation

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Date Picker Not Working**
- ✅ **Use SimpleLeaveForm** instead (provided in Teacher tab)

2. Verify database schema is deployed (see next section)
